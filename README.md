# Hello! We made a synthesizer using a Raspberry Pi, and here's what we did!
## Materials & getting started
First, we need the Raspberry Pi itself.
Second, an electronic keyboard piano for the sound input.
Third, an adapter to take the sound from the keyboard and input it into the Raspberry Pi.
Finally, the speaker so you can hear the métamorphoser in action!
- *"métamorphoser = fancy word for synthesizer*
